## This is my first blog post

Q: What do you think being a data scientsts is about?
A: Data scientist works with data to shine insights into them. From the data they reveal patterns, derive correlations and hypothesis, make predictions and direct business, scientific research or just to make fun.

Q: What do you see as the major duties or/and knowledge areas?
A: Compared with "traditional" data analytics, data scientist need to master the technique that are mainly used to manage large datasets (in giga bytes). Under large datasets the original data analysis tool like Excel and other GUI-based softwares are no longer suitable and need to analyze data in a more efficient way. They need to master technique to visualize the data, reveal the pattern and learn techniques to predict using the exisiting datasets. They also need to learn the statistics underlying big datasets because the distribution pattern is important when dealing with large datasets and is a good tool for data quality control.

Q: What are the similarities/differences between data scientists/statistician?
A: Similarities: they both deal with data, either for business or academia.
   Differences: Statistician is like hypothesis-driven scientists. They have a relatively clear hypothesis to start with, they gather data centered around that hypothesis and use that data to either reject or accept the hypothesis. On the other hand, data scientists are like scientists that are willing to start their project with -omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics--regarding biological research). They are less clear about their hypothesis, instead they let the data tell and refine their hypothesis. The rapid growth of technique to generate large datasets made this approach possible.

Q: How do you view yourself in relation to these two fields?
A: To me statistics provides the underlying mathematical basis of data science, I am more interested in becoming a data scientist.
